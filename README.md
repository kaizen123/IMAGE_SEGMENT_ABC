# IMAGE_SEGMENT_ABC
image segmentation based on Artificial Bee Colony algorithm and Hybrid ABC + GA

run sar.m file (gui file is sar.fig)

the parameter can be set as

No. of Bees -   10 to 100
Dim - 2
iterations - 10 t0 1000
probabilty - crossover probabiltiy can be between [0, 1] recommended 0.8
run - 1 or > 1

the work is an impplementation of the following reserach paper with one 
proposed model which is the hybridization of ABC and genetic algorithm crossover operator
